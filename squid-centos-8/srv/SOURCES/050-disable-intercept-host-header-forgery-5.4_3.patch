 	With NAT or TPROXY intercepted traffic Squid may pass the request
 	directly to the original client destination IP or seek a faster
 	source using the HTTP Host header.
 	
 	Using Host to locate alternative servers can provide faster
 	connectivity with a range of failure recovery options.
 	But can also lead to connectivity trouble when the client and
 	server are attempting stateful interactions unaware of the proxy.
 	
 	This option (on by default) prevents alternative DNS entries being
 	located to send intercepted traffic DIRECT to an origin server.
 	The clients original destination IP and port will be used instead.
 	
 	Regardless of this option setting, when dealing with intercepted
 	traffic Squid will verify the Host: header and any traffic which
 	fails Host verification will be treated as if this option were ON.
 	
 	see host_verify_strict for details on the verification process.
